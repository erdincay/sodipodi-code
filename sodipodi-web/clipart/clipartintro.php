Welcome to the Sodipodi <B>Clipart Page</B>.

Presently, an actively growing flag section is available.

<B>Regarding Flags:</B><BR>
The Flag collection is now hosted at <a href="http://www.openclipart.org/cgi-bin/navigate/signs_and_symbols/flags">openclipart.org</a>. The collection there is much more complete than the one hosted here. The flags here are kept here now for archieving purposes and to not break old links.
