Express donate 10 euros

<p>
Sodipodi is free software and remains that.
</p>

<p>
So you never do have to pay for using, distributing or
modifying it. But
even if not obliged,
it may still be good idea to
donate some money to free software project:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It is very positive feedback.
<li>It helps developers to justify buying cool hardware (tablets!)
    to their families. And then they will more probably write
    support for that cool hardware (tablets!).
<li>It keeps developers motivated to write the features
    users want, not those that are cool to write.
<li>It helps to present projects at exhibitions and shows,
    thus getting more publicity, more developers, more
    money...
<li>It keeps developers motivated to devote more time to
    given application than to their other projects.
<li>It helps to prove, that free software model works
    after all.
</ul>

<p>
For that reason the Sodipodi Fund has been established.
It is hosted by Lauris Kaplinski (Tartu, Estonia),
and used to support sodipodi development.
The rules of the fund are - of course - whatever
core developers decide. But we promise, that it will be
spend rationally - most important - we do not plan to use
your money to support closed source software.

For donating to Sodipodi Fund using credit card, click on the
Yaskifo link below. The minimum amount is 10 euros, more is
always welcome. We can lower the minimum, if needed, although
in that case the service fee will eat significant portion
of the share.

<p>
Also, if you want specific feature to be implemented,
let us know (you can send email directly to
<a href=\"lauris@kaplinski.com\">Lauris Kaplinski</a>
if you do not want to write to the list).
This is not anything like auction system, where
the biggest money gets served first. But we like helping users
- so keeping it yourself does no good.
