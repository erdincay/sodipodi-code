<h2>
Sodipodi under Windows
</h2>
<p>
Starting from version 0.29 sodipodi can be built under Windows 95+
environment. This is still in early development, but most original
features and original rendering engine work. Most notably
printing is not supported yet.
</p>
<p>
There is experimental binary available at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4054">
Sodipodi download site</a>. Do not
expect it to be as stable as Linux/Unix version yet - some
testing and learning is needed, before we get it right.
</p>
<h3>
Installing preview binary
</h3>
<p>
You need
Gtk+, libxml2
and
freetype2
runtime libraries. There
are certainly many sources for these - I personally used
<a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/packages/index.html">
Dev-C++ packages
</a>
for Gtk+ and libxml2, freetype binary can
be obtained from
<a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/freetype.htm">
GNUWin32 project</a>.
</p>
<p>
It is somewhat slower than Linux version because I have not got
assembler MMX optimizations compiling with Dev-cpp. If you know
how to do that, help is welcome.
</p>
<p>
Just unpack archive somewhere and start Sodipodi.exe. The only
requirement is 'glade' subdirectory being at the same place
as binary.
</p>
<h3>
Compiling sodipodi under windows
</h3>
<p>
Well, I can speak only about my experience. Certainly there
are more ways to do that...
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Install
<a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html">Dev-C++</a>.
I used version 5 beta 7 with MingW 2.95.
<li>
Download and install
<a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/packages/index.html">
Gtk+, i18n and libxml2
</a> development and runtime
packages.
<li>
Install
<a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/freetype.htm">
freetype2</a>
headers and libaries into applicable Dev-C++
directories. Install freetype.dll into standard directory
(windows/system or something like that).

<li>Download sodipodi source. You do need version 0.29
or later

<li>Download sodipodi-codepages-1.0.zip from sodipodi
download area and unpack it into src/libnrtype. This
contains unicode to windows charset mappings and should
be superseded by unicode layer for windows, but I have
not got the latter to work under Win98.

<li>
Install
<a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libart.htm">
libart_lgpl
</a>
into sodipodi source tree. Most probably
you can install windows dll too, but libart is small and
fast, so you can as well compile it in.
<li>
Create new Gtk+ project. Add all sodipodi sources to it.
<li>
Add empty config.h (or define whatever undefined variables there)
<li>
Compile
</ul>
<p>
Ah, and of course, any help with Windows version is welcome.
</p>
<h3>My config.h for those interested</h3>
