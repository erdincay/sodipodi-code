<h2>
Sodipodi on Windows
</h2>
<p>
Solution and project files for Microsoft Visual C++ .NET are
included in latest CVS sodipodi, in <b>build/vc7</b>
directory.
</p>
<p>
More information about prerequisites and build environment
setup can be read from <b>doc/MSVC_NET.txt</b>.
</p>
<p>
In addition to MSVC.NET, people have successfully built
sodipodi with MinGW, DevC++ and MS Visual C++ 6.0. We hope to
update CVS and documentation to cover more development
environments soon.
</p>


<h2>
Ancient building instructions (probably do not work for latest
sodipodi)
</h2>
<p>
Starting from version 0.29 sodipodi can be built under Windows 95+
environment. This is still in development, but most original
features and original rendering engine work.
</p>
<p>
There is experimental binary pacakges available at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4054">
Sodipodi download site</a>.
</p>
<h3>
Files
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sodipodi-0.32-Setup.exe - convenient setup program.</li>
<li>Sodipodi-0.32-sfx-archive.exe - self extracting archive
of sodipodi.</li>
<li>Sodipodi-0.32-Win32.exe - another self extracting archive</li>
</ul>
<p>
Usually you need only setup program. Archives may become
useful, if you already have Gtk and cousins installed.
Also, binary REQUIRES 'glade' subdirectory being in current
directory. I.e. if you create shortcut, be sure that working directory is
set to 'bin' under installation tree.
</p>
<p>
There seems to be some problem with Pango I was not able to
track down, so all Gtk+ widgets render text painfully
slowly. Sodipodi own rendering is quite snappy.

<h3>
Compiling sodipodi under windows
</h3>
<p>
Well, I can speak only about my experience. Certainly there
are more ways to do that...
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Install
<a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html">Dev-C++</a>.
I used version 5 beta 7 with MingW 2.95.
<li>
Download and install
<a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/packages/index.html">
Gtk+, i18n and libxml2
</a> development and runtime
packages.
<li>
Install
<a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/freetype.htm">
freetype2</a>
headers and libaries into applicable Dev-C++
directories. Install freetype.dll into standard directory
(windows/system or something like that).

<li>Download sodipodi source. You do need version 0.29
or later

<li>Download sodipodi-codepages-1.0.zip from sodipodi
download area and unpack it into src/libnrtype. This
contains unicode to windows charset mappings and should
be superseded by unicode layer for windows, but I have
not got the latter to work under Win98.

<li>
Install
<a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libart.htm">
libart_lgpl
</a>
into sodipodi source tree. Most probably
you can install windows dll too, but libart is small and
fast, so you can as well compile it in.
<li>
Create new Gtk+ project. Add all sodipodi sources to it.
<li>
Add empty config.h (or define whatever undefined variables there)
<li>
Compile
</ul>
<p>
Ah, and of course, any help with Windows version is welcome.
</p>
<h3>My config.h for those interested</h3>
