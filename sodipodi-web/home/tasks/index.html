<h3>Sodipodi Tasks</h3>

<p>
One of the best ways you can support Sodipodi development is to create
stuff for it.  Documentation/tutorials, code, sample graphics, and so on
are all things that will add value to Sodipodi.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to work on one of these tasks, send a note to the mailing
list, get hacking, and drop a line to the mailing list when you're done.
Patches can be sent in through the Sourceforge patch manager, or sent
directly to the mailing list if it's short.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to have yourself listed as the responsible party for a
task, just ask, and we'll put your name on it.  (We may de-list you if
we don't get status in a month or so.)
