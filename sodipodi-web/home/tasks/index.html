<h3>Sodipodi Tasks</h3>

<p>
One of the best ways you can support Sodipodi development is to create
stuff for it.  Documentation/tutorials, code, sample graphics, and so on
are all things that will add value to Sodipodi.

<p>
If you wish to work on one of these tasks, send a note to the mailing
list, and get hacking.  Patches can be sent in through the Sourceforge
patch manager, or sent directly to the mailing list if it's short.  In
either case, please always send a note to the mailing list when you
finish, so we have a record of it.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to have yourself listed as the responsible party for a
task, please mention this specifically; normally we won't list anyone
with a task until it's finished.  If we don't hear back from you within
a month, we may de-list your name (so someone else has a chance to take
the task.)
