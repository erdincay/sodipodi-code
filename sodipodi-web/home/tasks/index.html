<h3>Sodipodi Tasks</h3>

<p>
Here is a list of moderate sized tasks, for adding new features to
Sodipodi.  If you wish to work on one of these, send a note to the
mailing list, get hacking, and announce on the list when you're done.
Patches can be sent in through the Sourceforge patch manager, or sent
directly to the mailing list if it's short.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to have yourself listed as the responsible party for a
task for a while, just send a mail to <u>bryce at osdl dot org</u> or
the sodipodi mailing list, and we'll put your name on it.
