<h4>Symbols Library</h4>

<p>A collection of SVG symbols is to be created.  The user can access
these within Sodipodi - each symbol is displayed as a button.  Clicking
on the button causes the symbol to be imported into the drawing and
placed at the selected location.</p>

<p>The user can also choose to save objects from the current drawing to
the symbol library.
