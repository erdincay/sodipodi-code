<h3>Development</h3>

<p>
Sodipodi welcomes your contributions to help turn it into a great 2D
vector drawing tool for the Open Source community.  
</p>

<p>
While many developers work on fixing bugs and creating new features, it
is worth strong emphasis that even non-programmers can help make
Sodipodi more powerful and successful.  You probably already have an
idea of something in Sodipodi that you'd like to work on.  If not, here
are just a few ways you can help:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pick a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=4054&atid=104054">bug</a>, fix it, and <a href="">send in a patch</a></li>
  <li>Choose a <a href="/index.php3?section=development/tasks">feature</a> you want to see developed, and make it</li>
  <li>Find a new bug and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=4054&atid=104054">report it</a></li>
  <li>Help answer questions for new Sodipodians on IRC or the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=4054">mailing list</a></li>
  <li>Write an article advocating Sodipodi</li>
  <li>Author a HOWTO describing a trick or technique you've figured out</li>
  <li>Set up a gallery to share some examples of things you've made</li>
</ul>

the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=4054">Sodipodi 
mailing list</a>, to discuss development, problems, and techniques for
crafting cool SVG effects using Sodipodi.
