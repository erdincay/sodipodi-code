<h3>Development</h3>

<p>
Sodipodi is under constant development by a small group of people with
the purpose of turning it into a great 2D vector drawing tool for the
open source community.
</p>

<p>
One of the best ways you can support Sodipodi development is to create
stuff for it.  It is worth strong emphasis that you do not need
programming skills in order to help make Sodipodi more powerful and
successful.  Documentation, examples, tutorials, code, sample graphics,
button art and so on are all things that will add great value to
Sodipodi. 
</p>

<p>
Most likely, you already have an idea of something in Sodipodi that
you'd like to work on.  If not, please have a look see at the Tasks
page, which includes a breakdown of various new features and new
capabilities that the Sodipodi authors would appreciate outside help
with.
</p>

<p>
Besides direct development, another great way to help Sodipodi improve
is to submit 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=4054&atid=104054">bug
reports</a> and your ideas for 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=354054&group_id=4054&func=browse">new
features</a>, to the Sodipodi area of SourceForge.  Also, please join
the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=354054&group_id=4054&func=browse">Sodipodi 
mailing list</a>, to discuss development, problems, and techniques for
crafting cool SVG effects using Sodipodi.
