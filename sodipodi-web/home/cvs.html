The freshest Sodipodi can always be found at
<a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/">Gnome CVS</a>, module

<a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/sodipodi/">sodipodi</a>.
Well, strictly
speaking the absolute up to date version is in my computer, but I usually
keep the main CVS quite synchronized. What, of course, means, that
the code in CVS can be totally out of order. If it compiles, it is good,
if it runs, it is even better, but do not expect it to do the work!
</p>
<p>
Still, even if you are occasionally compiling programs yourself, 
using CVS pays back the little extra work.
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can get hands on new and cool features before the rest
<li>Bugs are fixed in CVS initially, until they find a way to release
<li>You can test new features and give feedback, before releases are done
</ul>
<p>
If you are unfamiliar with CVS, here is simple overview to get
started. This is shamelessly copied (and abbreviated) from
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html">http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html</a>,
so look there, if you want to get more information.
</p>
<p>
First set up CVSROOT environment variable:
<p>
<pre>
$ export CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome'
</pre>
<p>
Assuming you are running bash. If not, you probably know yourself, what
to do. Given CVSROOT points to readonly copy of Gnome CVS.
</p>
<p>
Then run the command:
</p>
<pre>
$ cvs login
</pre>
<p>
If asked for password, just press [Return]. You only need to run this
command once. All later accesses to the same CVSROOT will do login
automatically.
</p>
<p>
Now check out initial copy of sodipodi module:
</p>
<pre>
$ cvs -z3 checkout sodipodi
</pre>
<p>
The initial checkout may take some time, as all files have to be
downloaded to local computer. Updating local copy later is usually
much faster, as CVS download only differences between local copy
and server version.
</p>
<p>
CVS copy does not include all autoconf, automake and gettext
files, that are usually in released tarball. Most importantly
the configure script has yet to be generated. Just chdir into
base directory, and run:
<p>
<pre>
./autogen.sh [options]
</pre>
<p>
Where [options] are the same options you normally use for
configure.
</p>
<p>
If autogen.sh succeeds, just continue, as usual:
</p>
<pre>
make
make install
</pre>
<p>
If you want later to update your local copy to the latest
version in server, just chdir into source tree root, and run:
</p>
<pre>
cvs update -d
</pre>
<p>
Thats all. More information and link to general CVS documentation
