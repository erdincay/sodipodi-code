<h2>1. General questions</h2>
<h3>What does Sodipodi mean?</h3>
<p>
The same thing as 'sigrimigri'. In English it should be 'mishmesh',
'hotchapotcha', 'zigzag' ... you got the idea.
</p>

<h3>How do you pronounce it?</h3>
<p>
Like it is written in Estonian. If you happen to not to speak
Estonian, then Finnish will do.
</p>
<p>
Geez, you do not know Finnish too?! I think classical Latin
should be close. But notice, that 'd' is not voiced in
Estonian.
</p>
<p>
Still clueless? German pronouncication will do, if all else
fails.
</p>

<h3>Eee... does that means it is pronounced like 'soipoi'?</h3>
<p>
Geez, no!
</p>
<p>
Unvoiced sound is not the same as silent sound. Being unvoiced means,
that vocal chords are in rest, but otherwise sound is just normal.
</p>
<p>
Take for example the following pairs:
</p>
<ul>
<li> z and s
<li> v and f
</ul>
<p>
The first in pair is voiced, the second unvoiced variant of the same sound.
Similarly 'd' is voiced counterpart of 't' in many europaean languages,
but in Estonian it is just short and unstressed 't'. This is one of the few
places, where Estonian usage differs from the canonical pronouncication
of letters.
</p>

<h3>Stop joking. Is there tutorial or something?</h3>
<p>
Not yet. But why not to take it as excellent opportunity
to become famous by writing one. We all developers will be
very glad to help you.
</p>

<h3>Will there ever be version 1.0?</h3>
<p>
Quite improbable, unless somebody pays me for doing it. I am
totally opposed to the recent trend of certain open source companies
to name crappy beta products version 1 and marketing the hell
out of them.
</p>
<p>
In the current development model, Sodipodi will not be assigned
version number 1, unless each source file is triple audited
for clarity, speed and correctness, it implements the
whole SVG (except DOM), and runs reasonably well on computers with
32MB of RAM.
</p>

<h2>2. Architecture</h2>
<h3>There seems to be big code overlap between Sodipodi and
project X. Shouldn't you share more code?</h3>
<p>
Short answer: no.
</p>
<p>
Longer answer: theoretically possible, if the functionality
we are talking about is sufficently self-contained, we are
able to settle sensible clean and small API, and there
exist some serious framework for code sharing. But making
random pieces of code into shared libary is not an option.
</p>

<h2>3. Compiling</h2>
<h3>
**Error**: You must have Automake' installed to compile Sodipodi
</h3>
<p>
Sodipodi compiled just fine, but now trying to compile CVS,
I get this message. I am sure, I have automake 1.4 installed!
</p>
<p>
Masatake Yamato suggested the following trick:
</p>
<pre>
Try following commands:
$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/automake /usr/local/bin/automake-1.4
$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/aclocal  /usr/local/bin/aclocal-1.4
$ ./autogen.sh

When running automake & autoconf manually, don't forget to run aclocal.

BTW, I think the human race need autoauto that encapsulates the 
difference of autotools versions;-P
</pre>
<p>
Also, downloading latest autoconf 1.4 tarball and installing it
manually has worked for some people.
</p>

<h2>4. Usage</h2>

<h3>How resource-hungry is Sodipodi?</h3>
<p>
It is, although much less than gigants like Nautilus and
Evolution.
</p>
<p>
Sodipodi is currently developed on Celeron 500 with 128MB of RAM and
runs well on it. Of course, for complex graphics and long
bezier lines faster processor does better.
</p>
<p>
I have used it on Pentium 166 with 32MB memory, and the
user experience was still pleasant.
</p>
<p>
Also, notice that its fine antialiased display is achieved
by using XImage extensively. For networked X displays it means,
that you do need at least 100Mbps network. But that does
not matter, if X runs on your local computer.
</p>

<h3>I have hand-created SVG. Will everything be messed up, if I load
and save it with Sodipodi?</h3>
<p>
It depends. Sodipodi tries to change as little as possible, unless
explicitly or implicitly needed. But some things just happen.
</p>
<ul>
<li>All objects will get unique "id" attributes. If already
    existing and unique, they will be preserved, otherwise one
    will be derived from node name.
<li>Some sodipodi namespaced metadata will be added to the
    beginning of document.
<li>If you change anything in gradient, given gradient will be
    moved to standardized place into &lt;defs&gt; node at the
    beginning of document and broken up into 2 linked gradients
    - one defining color vector, another one position.
<li>Saving document as 'plain SVG' actually invokes exporter.
    All objects will be reconstructed from parsed data, but
    overall object hierarchy will be preserved.
<li>Changing any style property forces reconstructing of the
    whole 'style' attribute.
</ul>
<p>
Everything else should be straightforward - changing any
attribute makes sodipodi to write this into file in a way
it likes best.
</p>

<h3>I have heard there are cool command-line arguments.
Is this true?</h3>
<p>
There are some. Among other things you can use sodipodi to
print or convert SVG file to bitmap from console, even on
machines without running X (but you need Gtk+ and X libraries
installed still).
</p>
<p>
Try
<pre>sodipodi --help</pre>
for list of supported arguments.
