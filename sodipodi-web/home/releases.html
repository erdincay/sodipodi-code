There are no stable sodipodi releases yet. Still time to time I do
build and release distribution tarballs.  Although not of
production quality, these are still stabler
and more tested, than is the usual state of affairs in CVS.
And many nice people have done binary packages of sodipodi.

<h3>Sodipodi 0.31 release notes</h3>
<p>
This is the second bugfix release after switching to Gtk+ 2.0. Hopefully
all internals are stabilized now and we can continue with
features.
</p>
<p>
There was nasty redraw bug, causing full window to be constantly
repainted (and layout recalculated), thus making Sodipodi
painfully slow if big windows and complex graphics were used.
</p>

<p>
Highlights (in the order of Changelog):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster radial gradients (Lauris)</li>
<li>Update changed region, not full display (Lauris)</li>
<li>Made sticky zoom working (Lauris)</li>
<li>Dropper tool (Lauris)</li>
<li>Handful of minor bugfixes (Lauris)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sodipodi 0.30 release notes</h3>
<p>
This is bugfix release, cleaning some most rough corners
of 0.29.
There was quite nasty bug disturbing rotated paths in node edit
mode, making sodipodi mostly unusable for real work. This, and
some other minor ones, are fixed now.
</p>

<p>
Highlights (in the order of Changelog):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not crash on entity declarations (Lauris)</li>
<li>Implemented almost full viewport support in &lt;svg&gt; (Lauris)</li>

<h3>Sodipodi 0.29 release notes</h3>
<p>
This is the first version using Gtk+ 2.0 widget set and
updated support libraries. So it is probably quite buggy
inside and out.
</p>
<p>
The number of required libraries has come down considerably.
Most importantly you do not need gnome libraries anymore,
libgnomeprint and libgnomeprintui are optional. Thus building
it should be much easier.
</p>
<p>
This version should compile on Windows 95/98/ME/2000/XP.
The support is still in very early phase of development,
so it may require some tweaking, depending on actual
build system used.
</p>

<p>
Highlights (in the order of Changelog):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Port to Gtk+ 2.0 (Mitsuru)
<li>Removed libgnome, libgnomeui, libgal dependencies,
    reimplement missing pieces (Mitsuru)
<li>Gnome print support is now compile time option (Lauris)
<li>Smooth canvas scroll (Lauris)
<li>Initial direct PostScript print implementation (Lauris)
<li>Windows32 port (Lauris)
<li>Support GtkIM in text context (MenTaLguY)
<li>Fixed namespace loading code (MenTaLguY)
<li>Optional loading of Xft font database (Lauris)
<li>Control constrains draw to 15 degrees instead of 90 (Nathan)
<li>Fixed linear grid snapping code (Nathan)
<li>Allow multiple toolboxes and toolbox docking (Lauris)
</ul>

<h3>Sodipodi 0.28 release notes</h3>
<p>
This release is mostly about speed. Using locally modified
canvas port we were able to made sodipodi so much more
responsive, we felt the need to share it with community.
</p>
<p>
Highlights (in order of Changelog):
</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminated lagging-behind-UI event queues (me)
<li>Eliminated expensive intersection tests for select-only updates (me)
<li>MMX optimizations for most heavily used pixel operations (me)
<li>Compilation speedups (me)
<li>Way to add custom freetype-readable fonts, thus having real
    vertical metrics (me)
<li>Fully dynamic XML editor (MenTaLguY)
<li>Combine and Convert to curve work on multiple items selected (Masatake)
<li>userSpaceOnUse units are supported, so nautilus-readable icons
    can be drawn with sodipodi (me)
<li>Way to specify reflect and repeat gradient spreads (me)
<li>Patterned lines (me)
<li>Node editing has stamping too (Masatake)
</ul>

<li>Patterns are displayed (no editing yet) (me)
<li>You can enter arbitrary unicode values in text context (me)
<li>Much faster text display (me)

<h3>Sodipodi 0.26 release notes</h3>
<p>
As one could expect, previous release was quite buggy. Some of them
were nasty enough, to justify bugfix release.
</p>
<p>
Highlights:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Works now on locales using ',' as decimal separator
<li>Writes DTD correctly, so Sodipodi files are viewable with Adobe
    SVG plugin
<li>Text is editable in place
<li>Plain SVG saving mode
<li>Recently opened files list
<li>Fill rule can be changed
<li>Lots of bugfixes
</ul>

<h3>Sodipodi 0.25 release notes</h3>
<p>
Too much time has passed from the last release. Lot has changed
inside sodipodi, so do expect this release to be buggier and slower
than 0.24. But otherwise it is cool and no doubt together we can
make it better for the next release.
</p>
<p>
Highlights:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Text object manages now the whole tree of &lt;tspan&gt; and TEXT nodes,
multiline text thus being compatible with SVG specification. Old sodipodi
files will be converted to new format automatically if opened.
<li>Linear gradient unit space and transformation is now calculated
correctly. Only viewport relative percentages are not supported.
<li>Style parsing and inheritance is much better now. Specifically
most distances are now handled correctly.
<li>There is working pen tool in addition to pencil.
<li>XML tree is now completely editable. (Pawel)
<li>Vertical writing mode is supported, although font metrics
are emulated.
<li>Line width behaves as it should bot in display and print.
<li>Text object gradient is correct in display mode too.
<li>Stroke can have gradient fill. No printing yet, but it does
work in display and bitmap export.
<li>Command line arguments are working. Plus there are arguments to
convert SVG to PNG from command line (no X needed)
<li>There are nifty star, spiral and arc tool, the latter replacing
old ellipse tool. (Mitsuru)
<li>Bitmaps can be traced to vector from context menu, using
autotrace and frontline. (Masatake)
<li>Several objects have now property dialogs and node editing mode. (Mitsuru)
<li>There is tool options dialog for some tools.
</ul>

<h3>Sodipodi History</h3>

<p>
At the beginning there was Gill; this was meant to be the Gnome
illustration program.  Gnome initially had big hopes around the DOM
infrastructure.  I started playing with Gill and ezpaint code.
EZPaint was an experimental set of interactive items for gnome-canvas. 
</p>

<p>
It took about a year before people got used of sodipodi as The
Gnome Illustaration program, then about a year ago Mitsuru or somebody
asked, that I should try to port it to Windows.  This opened my eyes.
Ah, and I got letter from some people.  Someone said, he was using KDE,
he disliked gnome, but he installed it just to compile sodipodi :-)
</p>

<p>
So basically sodipodi has just been evolving, making some twists here
and there, and nobody knows where it will evolve in next 2 years.
</p>

<p> 
I like the fact that it still has potential for more than one
application unlike gnumeric, for example which was, is and will be
spreadsheet very probably.
