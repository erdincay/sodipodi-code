i sat down the othe rday and thought i might try some techniques i'd managed 
in GIMP (and written a tutorial for on biggyp.tk) with sodipodi, this 
splash screen mock up thingy is the result.

thanks for such a superb vector editing package, sodipodi is the perfect 
complement to the GIMP :)  -- Phil.
