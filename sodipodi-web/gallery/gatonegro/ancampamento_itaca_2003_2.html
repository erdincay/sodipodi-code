A poster made to advertise a summercamp conducted
by the Asociacion Xuvenil Itaca 
<a href="http://www.federacionitaca.org">(http://www.federacionitaca.org)</a>.
I did not see
any other poster in the Sodipodi galleries, so it
may be interesting as an example. Designed to be 
black and white photocopied on DIN-A3 (or larger)
coloured paper, and cut along the diagonal, which
doubles the amount of posters (thin economy) and
provides an original poster shape.
