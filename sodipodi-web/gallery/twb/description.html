<p>
Trent Buck is a CompSci student and a <a

from Melbourne, Australia.

He has no actual artistic talent, so his work tends to be hard-edged
ikons or outright, vectorized theft.

There are no
restrictions for the use of these images,
except that some of these are
actually logos of existing entities and thus normal
trademark and brand rules apply.
