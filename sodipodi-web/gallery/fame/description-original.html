<h2>Sodipodi "GNOME Hall of Fame"</h2>

<div>The Hall of Fame has caused some confusion and a few negative remarks (as well
as positive). To make things clear - this is not official, GNOME Advisory board
supported venture. Rather the HOF is a humorous project that thrives to create
somewhat humorous but nevertheless friendly portraits of some of the people that we
(and anyone who cares to email us) consider important to the GNOME project and of 
course for our own Sodipodi program.</div>

<h3>On to the Hall</h3>

<div><a href="index.php?section=projects&file=halloffame&showfirst=0">
Please click here without further delay
</a></div>

<h3>Entries</h3>

<div>entries in the hall should be ordered alphabetically. If they are not, it is by 
pure chance only and if it bothers you, please email us and state the problem.<7div>
For every entry we have a portrait (To download it in SVG format, please click the 
image) and a short description of the person in question. If we find more 
information and have the time to put it together, there is also, for every person, a 
dedicated page for biography, link to personal homepage or whatever.</div>

<h3>Our Goal</h3>

<div>The goal of HOF is to establish a page where one can find quick information and 
links to further investigate. Not to mention - to advertise the Sodipodi project by 
providing something else besides tarballs. To further any of these goals, your help 
is most welcome.</div>

<h3>Nominations</h3>

<div>We are happy to her about anyone who should, but is not, in the HOF. at the 
moment, the gallery is still rather limited, the reason being mostly us having lots 
of other things to do besides searching the web. If you know of someone that should 
be her, please email us with as much information as you know. A picture, his or her 
doings and goings, adresses for more information - whatever you can come up 
with.</div>
