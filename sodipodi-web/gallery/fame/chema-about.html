<h2>Chema Celorio</h2>

<h3>Personal info</h3>

<div>A rather bleak homepage can be found at <a
href="http://www.celorio.com/gnomestuff/index.html">
http://www.celorio.com/gnomestuff/index.html</a> and a bleaker one at <a
href="http://canvas.gnome.org/~chema/"> http://canvas.gnome.org/~chema/</a>.  
I would rather suggest you visit Chemas <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/person/chema/"> Advogato page</a>. The diary is
not that well-kept, but has a few highlights.</div>

<div><a href="http://guadec.gnome.dk/abstracts/?person=chema">Here</a> is a 
brief abstract about Chema from Gueadec 2001.</a></div>

<div>Chema is working in <a hreF="http://www.ximian.com">Ximian Inc</a> at the 
moment.</a></div>

<h3>Contributions</h3>

<div>Chema doesn't advertise himself much, but he has done a lot of work with 
gedit, gnome-print and gnumeric. His main responsibility seems to be <a 
href="http://www.ximian.com/desktop/setuptools.php3"> The Ximian Setup 
Tools</a>. To get an overview, look in the <a 
href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/setup-tool-hackers/">mailing 
list</a>. Also, the <a 
href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/gnome-print/">gnome-print
mailing list</a> is a good point to read some heated argumentation.</div>

<h3>Misc info</h3>

<div>Chema, from Mexico, might frequent the Spanish Slashdot - <a
href="http://www.barrapunto.com">Barrapunto</a>. Other than that, Chema has 
been hard to investigate.</div>
