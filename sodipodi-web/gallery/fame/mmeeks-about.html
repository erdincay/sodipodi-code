<H2>Michael Meeks</h2>

<h3>Personal info</h3>

<div>Michael keeps a personal on-line diary that you can find at <a
href="http://www.gnome.org/~michael">www.gnome.org/~michael</a>. He also suggests you
visit the <a href="http://www.webcom.com/~ctt">Unraveling Wittgenstein's net</a>
site.</div>

<div>Michael is currently employed by <a href="http://www.ximian.com">Ximian Inc</a>, 
but I was unable to find out what exactly he is doing there.</div>

<h3>Contributions</h3>

<div>Not knowing him better, I cite  <a 
href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2000-October/msg00078.html">an 
email</a> he sent to the gnome-foundation list:<br>

<pre>
	I hacked variously around gnumeric contributing to
gnome-print, gnome-libs & gdk-pixbuf in a reassuringly minor way.
Jody and I also created Gnome Basic to solve some of the Excel macro
problems that our users were having.</pre>

<pre>
	Then I got sucked into the exciting Bonobo thing, and hacked
miscellaneously on a number of projects relating vaguely to this:
glade, libglade, gnome-vfs, evolution, gtkhtml, eog, xpdf, gnome-db,
guppi3, sodipodi, achtung, nautilus, oaf and ORBit alongside all
manner of new and interesting people. But mainly I concentrated on
Bonobo's core.</pre>

things of GNOME and around it, see <a
