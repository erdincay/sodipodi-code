Artist Info: Frustrated by too many years of programming, Burton
decided to go through his old sketchbooks and try to figure out how to
make pretty pictures instead of just admiring them. After
experimenting with a variety of programs, he chose Sodipodi as his
main illustration tool, and uses gimp for final image compositing and
manipulation. For a complete gallery, other works and contact info
please go to his home page at http://kruhftwerk.dyndns.org.
