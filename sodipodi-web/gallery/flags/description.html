Below is the Sodipodi International Flag and Civic Heraldry Collection.  
SVG versions of flags from different countries from around the world are
provided for public use.  Note that these may not be authoritatively
correct (colors, dimensions, etc.) but if you know the correct RGB
triplets, feel free to send a corrected version to the Sodipodi web
administors.  Also see 
<a href="http://flagspot.net/">http://flagspot.net/</a> for details
about flags around the world and
