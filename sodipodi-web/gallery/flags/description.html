Below is the Sodipodi International Flag and Civic Heraldry Collection.  
SVG versions of flags from different countries from around the world are
provided for public use.  Note that these may not be authoritatively
correct (colors, dimensions, etc.) but if you know the correct RGB
triplets, feel free to send a corrected version to the Sodipodi web
administors.  Also see 
<a href="http://flagspot.net/">http://flagspot.net/</a> and <A HREF="http://www.flags.net">flags.net</A> for details
about flags around the world and 
<a href="http://www.ngw.nl/">http://www.ngw.nl/</a> for civic heraldry.
</p>
<P>All these flags are available in the public domain. Read the <A HREF="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/">Creative commons public domain dedication</A>.</P>
<p>
If submitting flag, please scale document to correct aspect ratio,
with shorter edge being 140mm, and make flag to cover the whole
page area. This makes generating bitmaps automatically much easier.
Also make sure to state in your mail that the flags are donated to the <A HREF="http://creativecommons.org/license/publicdomain-2">public 
domain</A> by following the steps outlined in that link.  We do not want submissions of non-civic or fictional flags.
</p>
<p>
Also, if the official dimensions of flag have other aspect ratio than
3:2, it may be good idea to submit both official and 3:2 versions. The
latter will be useful in situations, where all flags have to be
identically shaped (for example list of buttons for different languages
in user interface).
